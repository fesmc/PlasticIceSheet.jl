# PlasticIceSheet.jl — design & plan

A small, AD-friendly Julia package that reconstructs a perfectly-plastic, steady-state
ice-sheet surface from three inputs — a **grounded-ice margin/mask**, a **basal shear
stress field** `τ(x,y)`, and a **bed topography** `B(x,y)` — by solving the governing
equation as a static Hamilton–Jacobi (eikonal-type) problem on a grid.

It is intended as a *complementary first-guess tool* alongside a full dynamic model
(Yelmo) and an independent 3-D GIA / sea-level solver — e.g. to seed spin-up, to
provide an elevation field for an SMB model, or as a relaxation target. It is **not**
a dynamic model and carries no transient, thermomechanics, or ice-shelf physics.

ICESHEET is GPL-3.0. This is a clean-room reimplementation of the *physics* (one
published equation, below); none of the Fortran source is copied. License choice for
this package is TBD (see Open questions).

## The physics we keep

The entire scientific content of ICESHEET is one equation — the perfectly-plastic,
steady-state ice surface, where driving stress balances basal shear stress everywhere
(paper Eq. 5):

```
|∇E| = τ / (ρ_i g (E − B)) = τ / (ρ_i g H),    H = E − B ≥ 0
```

with `E` the ice surface elevation, `B` the bed, `H` the thickness, `τ` the basal shear
stress, `ρ_i` ice density, `g` gravity. Boundary condition: `H = 0` (`E = B`) at the
margin, plus a marine flotation thickness `H = −B(1 − ρ_w/ρ_i)` where the grounded
margin sits below sea level.

This is a **static Hamilton–Jacobi equation**. The viscosity solution of an upwind grid
scheme automatically produces the correct surface where flow would converge — so
**saddles, domes, and coalescing ice caps emerge for free**, with no flowline tracing.

### Two solve modes

1. **`:flat` — flat-bed eikonal (simple case).** Neglect bed slope in the flux
   (`|∇E| ≈ |∇H|`). Substituting `u = H²` gives a textbook eikonal:

   ```
   |∇u| = 2τ / (ρ_i g),     u = 0 at the margin
   ```

   Solve, then `H = √u`, `E = H + B`. Exact eikonal; ideal when bed relief ≪ ice
   thickness (continental interiors). The paper's own sensitivity tests indicate the
   bed-gradient terms are second-order except in mountainous terrain.

2. **`:hj` — full Hamilton–Jacobi (default).** Solve directly for `E`:

   ```
   |∇E| = τ / (ρ_i g (E − B))
   ```

   The right-hand side depends on `E` at the node (`f = f(x, E)`, monotone decreasing
   in `E`), so each Godunov node update is a local nonlinear solve (a few inner
   iterations / local Newton). Correct over arbitrary bed relief.

### Numerics

- **Fast sweeping** (Zhao 2005): Gauss–Seidel with the Godunov upwind Hamiltonian,
  alternating the four diagonal sweep orderings, iterated to a tolerance on the max
  update. O(N) per sweep, a handful of sweeps to converge.
- Godunov update at node `(i,j)` with spacing `h`, neighbor minima `a, b`:
  - if `|a − b| ≥ F h`: `u = min(a, b) + F h`
  - else: `u = (a + b + √(2 F² h² − (a − b)²)) / 2`
  where `F = 2τ/(ρ_i g)` (flat mode) or the `E`-dependent local solve (HJ mode).

This replaces the ~2,600-line recursive flowline/crossover/saddle machinery of ICESHEET
(`find_flowline_fisher_adaptive_4.f90`) with a kernel on the order of ~150–250 lines.

## What we deliberately drop (vs. ICESHEET)

Given the intended use (first guess; external GIA; Yelmo for dynamics), we drop:

- **Method-of-characteristics flowline tracing** and all of its bookkeeping: crossover
  detection / motorcycle-graph algorithm, saddle & dome detection, polygon splitting,
  recursion, adaptive contour resampling. Subsumed by the grid HJ solver.
- **The GIA / sea-level iteration loop** (CALSEA/SELEN coupling, `global/deform/`,
  `selen_format.sh`, …). The package consumes a bed `B`; the user owns GIA.
- **The GMT projection/preprocessing pipeline** (`run.sh`, `prepare_icesheet.sh`,
  `create_ss_grid.f90`, shapefile→τ domains, `reduce_dem`, `nearest_int`, `bicubic`,
  `diff_map`) and the hand-rolled GMT binary-record grid reader (`grids.f90`). Replaced
  by in-memory arrays now, NetCDF I/O via a package extension later.
- **The offshore boundary Nye-smoothing pre-pass** — the HJ scheme enforces the maximum
  surface slope intrinsically.
- **The iterative τ-tuning shell loop** (`adjust_ss`) — replaced by gradient-based
  optimization of `τ` enabled by AD (see below).

## What we keep / add

- Inputs: grounded-ice mask, bed `B`, shear-stress field `τ` (or a constant / a
  low-dimensional parameterization).
- Plastic physics + marine flotation BC at the grounding line.
- Gridded outputs: surface `E`, thickness `H`, plus reductions (volume, area).
- **AD-friendliness**: the solver is written so that a scalar loss on the output
  (e.g. misfit to a target surface, or to Yelmo) can be differentiated w.r.t. `τ`,
  enabling gradient-based inversion of basal shear stress — the modern replacement for
  ICESHEET's manual domain tuning.

## Caveats (carried from the physics)

- Steady-state geometry only; biased thick/peaked where the real ice was streaming or
  dynamic (low effective driving stress the plastic assumption can't see).
- `τ` is the free field carrying essentially all the uncertainty. For a first guess a
  constant (~50–100 kPa) or a bed-keyed value is fine; don't over-interpret as a
  constrained reconstruction.

## Open questions / decisions

- **AD backend & strategy** (forward-through-solver vs. implicit/adjoint at the fixed
  point; Enzyme vs. ForwardDiff vs. Zygote) — depends on whether `τ` is a full per-cell
  field or a low-dimensional parameterization. *To be decided before the core lands.*
- License (ICESHEET is GPL-3.0; this is a clean-room physics reimplementation).
- NetCDF I/O as a package extension (`ext/`).

## Implementation notes (v0.1)

- **Both modes solve for `w = H²`**, not the surface `E` directly: the driving slope
  `τ/(ρ_i g H)` blows up at the margin (`H→0`) and biases a direct-`E` solve low. `:flat`
  is the plain eikonal `|∇w| = 2τ/(ρ_i g)`; `:hj` adds the bed-gradient correction.
- **`:hj` damping.** The `:hj` effective RHS `√(G² − 4√w(∇B·∇w) − 4w|∇B|²)` carries `∇w`,
  so "freeze RHS, re-solve" is not contractive — undamped it oscillates over real relief.
  It is solved by a **damped (under-relaxed) Picard iteration** (`relax`, default 0.5).
  Very steep beds (relief ≈ ice thickness over a few cells) may still not converge.
- **Reverse-mode AD** (`differentiable_thickness`, extension keyed on
  `ImplicitDifferentiation`): implicit differentiation of the converged Godunov residual
  `godunov_residual(w, τ) = 0`. `:flat` gradients are exact to machine precision; `:hj`
  gradients are exact once the damped forward solve has driven the residual to ≈ 0 (hence
  the firmer `n_outer`/`outer_tol` defaults on that path). The forward fast sweep is a
  black box; only the residual is differentiated (ForwardDiff), so AD cost is independent
  of sweep/outer-iteration count and scales to a full per-cell `τ` field.
- **NaN hygiene**: `√w` is floored at `H_min²` wherever it is differentiated (`sqrt(0)`
  has an infinite derivative that otherwise poisons the reverse pass).
